# this will run the docter container for postgres by itself
# you can use the docker compose task to run and setup the full container with the api (and soon to be UI)
# Look at the entity framework migrationshelp.txt to get the latest migration to a new docker instance
#  the tests destroy and re-create the containers.  still figuring out how that happens by default
#  this is a good container to run if you just want a database and to develop locally outside of the containers first
